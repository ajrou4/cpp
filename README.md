        Syntax and structure
        Basic data types
        Input/Output
        Control structures (loops, conditionals)
        Functions and scope

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
        Classes and Objects
        Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
        Constructors and Destructors
        Operator overloading

    Memory Management
        Pointers and references
        Dynamic memory allocation
        Smart pointers
        RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

    Advanced C++ Concepts
        Templates and generic programming
        STL (Standard Template Library) usage
        Iterators and algorithms
        Exception handling

    Code Optimization and Best Practices
        Writing efficient C++ code
        Code refactoring
        Debugging and profiling tools
        Adhering to C++ coding standards

#Getting Started
#Prerequisites

Before starting the C++ Pool, you should be comfortable with basic programming concepts. Experience with another programming language, such as C, is beneficial but not required.
Environment Setup

    Compiler: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. The recommended compiler is clang++ or g++.
    Editor: You can use any text editor or IDE you prefer. Common choices include Vim, Emacs, VSCode, or CLion.
    Version Control: Familiarize yourself with Git, as you'll need it to manage your projects and submit your work.

Running the Code

To compile and run your C++ code, you can use the following command:

bash

g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 -o program_name source_file.cpp
./program_name

Project Submission

    Submit your projects using the Git submission process outlined by 42 School.
    Ensure that your code adheres to the Norm and that you've tested your code thoroughly before submission.

Tips for Success

    Practice Regularly: The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with C++.
    Read Documentation: The C++ reference (cppreference.com) is an invaluable resource.
    Collaborate: Don't hesitate to ask for help from peers and participate in group study sessions.
    Debugging: Learn to use debugging tools like gdb or lldb to trace and fix issues in your code.
    Test Thoroughly: Write test cases for your code to ensure it handles all edge cases.
